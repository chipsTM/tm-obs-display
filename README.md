## An extensible way to display TM data such as VehicleState through OBS or web browser

---

## Features
- Allows data from TM to be displayed in OBS or browser via WebSockets (one-way only) (NOTE: THESE ARE UNSECURE SOCKETS)
- All customization is intended to be performed in the webpage directly (use presets as a reference for customization)

Currently only the data is from VehicleState. Additional data can be made available (contact me on the Openplanet discord)

### Potential future updates
- better Presets (keyboard, pad, gearbox, speed, etc.) 
- customization window
- native HTTP Server


## Changelog

### v0.1.0
- Initial Release
